## 1. Core Fundamentals

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements while optimizing for scalability, performance, and maintainability.

### 1.1. System Design Basics

**System Design Definition:**
System design is the conceptual design that defines the structure and behavior of a system. It involves breaking down a complex system into smaller, manageable components that work together to achieve the desired functionality.

**Key Components:**
- **Architecture**: High-level structure and organization
- **Components**: Individual modules and services
- **Interfaces**: Communication protocols between components
- **Data Models**: Structure and organization of data
- **Algorithms**: Core processing logic and workflows

**Design Process:**
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding functional and non-functional requirements
2. **High-Level Design**: Overall system architecture and component identification
3. **Detailed Design**: Specific implementation details for each component
4. **Validation**: Ensuring design meets requirements and constraints
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive design documentation

### 1.2. Characteristics of Good System Design

**Essential Characteristics:**
- **Modularity**: System divided into discrete, interchangeable components
- **Abstraction**: Hide complex implementation details behind simple interfaces
- **Encapsulation**: Bundle data and methods that operate on data
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different aspects handled by different components
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different contexts
- **Testability**: Components can be tested independently

**Quality Attributes:**
```
Reliability: System performs correctly during specified conditions
Availability: System remains operational when needed
Scalability: System handles increased load gracefully
Performance: System meets timing and throughput requirements
Security: System protects against unauthorized access
Maintainability: System can be modified and updated easily
```

### 1.3. Design Goals and Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
Define what the system should do - the specific behaviors and functions.

**Examples:**
- User authentication and authorization
- Data storage and retrieval operations
- Business logic processing
- Integration with external systems
- Reporting and analytics features

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
Define how the system should perform - quality attributes and constraints.

**Categories:**
```
Performance Requirements:
- Response time: Maximum acceptable latency
- Throughput: Requests processed per unit time
- Capacity: Maximum users or data volume

Reliability Requirements:
- Availability: Uptime percentage (99.9%, 99.99%)
- Fault tolerance: Graceful degradation under failures
- Recovery time: Time to recover from failures

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: User identity verification
- Authorization: Access control and permissions
- Data encryption: Protection of sensitive data
- Audit logging: Tracking of system activities
```

### 1.4. Scalability

**Scalability Types:**

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):**
- Add more servers to handle increased load
- Distribute load across multiple machines
- Better fault tolerance but increased complexity

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):**
- Increase capacity of existing servers
- Add more CPU, RAM, or storage
- Simpler implementation but limited by hardware constraints

**Mathematical Models:**
```
Linear Scalability: Performance ∝ Resources
Ideal: doubling resources doubles performance

Sub-linear Scalability: Performance < Resources
Reality: coordination overhead reduces efficiency

Scalability Factor = Performance_Gain / Resource_Increase
Perfect scaling: Factor = 1.0
Typical systems: Factor = 0.6-0.8
```

**Scalability Dimensions:**
- **Load Scalability**: Handle increasing request volume
- **Data Scalability**: Manage growing data sets
- **Geographic Scalability**: Serve users across different regions
- **Administrative Scalability**: Manage larger organizations

### 1.5. Reliability and Availability

**Reliability:**
Probability that system performs correctly during specific duration under stated conditions.

**Reliability Metrics:**
```
MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures): Average operational time between failures
MTTR (Mean Time To Repair): Average time to restore system after failure
MTTF (Mean Time To Failure): Average time until first failure

Reliability R(t) = e^(-λt)
where λ = failure rate, t = time

System Reliability = ∏(Component_Reliability_i)
for components in series
```

**Availability:**
Percentage of time system is operational and accessible.

**Availability Calculations:**
```
Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)
Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)

Common Availability Levels:
99.9% (8.77 hours downtime/year)
99.99% (52.6 minutes downtime/year)
99.999% (5.26 minutes downtime/year)
```

**High Availability Techniques:**
- **Redundancy**: Multiple instances of critical components
- **Failover**: Automatic switching to backup systems
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health checks

### 1.6. Performance Characteristics

**Performance Metrics:**

**Latency:**
Time taken to process a single request from start to completion.

**Types of Latency:**
```
Network Latency: Time for data to travel across network
Processing Latency: Time for server to process request
Database Latency: Time for database operations
End-to-End Latency: Total time from user action to response

Latency Percentiles:
P50 (Median): 50% of requests complete within this time
P95: 95% of requests complete within this time
P99: 99% of requests complete within this time
P99.9: 99.9% of requests complete within this time
```

**Throughput:**
Number of requests processed per unit time.

**Throughput Measurements:**
```
QPS (Queries Per Second): Database query throughput
RPS (Requests Per Second): HTTP request throughput
TPS (Transactions Per Second): Business transaction throughput

Little's Law: L = λ × W
L = Average number of requests in system
λ = Arrival rate (throughput)
W = Average response time (latency)
```

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in fast storage
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple servers
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing, query optimization, connection pooling
- **Content Delivery Networks**: Geographic distribution of static content

### 1.7. Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery

**Fault Tolerance:**
System's ability to continue operating despite component failures.

**Fault Tolerance Strategies:**
```
Redundancy: Multiple copies of critical components
Replication: Data stored in multiple locations
Circuit Breakers: Prevent cascade failures
Graceful Degradation: Reduce functionality instead of complete failure
Timeout and Retry: Handle temporary failures
```

**Failure Models:**
- **Fail-Stop**: Component stops working but failure is detectable
- **Fail-Slow**: Component continues working but with degraded performance
- **Byzantine Failures**: Component behaves arbitrarily or maliciously
- **Network Partitions**: Communication failures between components

**Disaster Recovery:**
Plan and procedures for recovering from catastrophic failures.

**Recovery Objectives:**
```
RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Maximum acceptable downtime
RPO (Recovery Point Objective): Maximum acceptable data loss

DR Strategies:
Hot Standby: Immediate failover with real-time replication
Warm Standby: Quick failover with periodic data synchronization
Cold Standby: Manual failover with backup restoration

DR Site Types:
Hot Site: Fully equipped and operational backup site
Warm Site: Partially equipped site requiring setup time
Cold Site: Basic infrastructure requiring full setup
```

## 2. Design Principles & Patterns

Design principles and patterns provide proven solutions to common design problems and help create maintainable, extensible, and robust systems.

### 2.1. SOLID Principles

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**Benefits:**
- Easier to understand and modify
- Reduced coupling between components
- Better testability and maintainability

**Example:**
```
// Violation of SRP
class UserService {
    saveUser(user) { /* database operations */ }
    sendEmail(user) { /* email operations */ }
    validateUser(user) { /* validation logic */ }
}

// Following SRP
class UserRepository {
    saveUser(user) { /* database operations */ }
}

class EmailService {
    sendEmail(user) { /* email operations */ }
}

class UserValidator {
    validateUser(user) { /* validation logic */ }
}
```

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Implementation Strategies:**
- Abstract base classes and interfaces
- Plugin architectures
- Strategy pattern
- Decorator pattern

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking functionality.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

### 2.2. Core Design Principles

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

**Benefits:**
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Consistency across codebase
- Single point of truth for business logic

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
Systems work best when they are kept simple rather than made complicated.

**Application:**
- Choose simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid premature optimization
- Clear and readable code
- Minimal viable solutions

**YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):**
Don't implement functionality until it's actually needed.

**Separation of Concerns:**
Separate different aspects of a program into distinct sections.

**Examples:**
```
Presentation Layer: User interface and user experience
Business Logic Layer: Core application functionality
Data Access Layer: Database operations and data persistence
Infrastructure Layer: Cross-cutting concerns (logging, security)
```

### 2.3. Coupling and Cohesion

**Loose Coupling:**
Components should have minimal dependencies on each other.

**Benefits:**
- Independent development and testing
- Easier maintenance and modification
- Better reusability
- Reduced ripple effects from changes

**Techniques for Loose Coupling:**
- Dependency injection
- Event-driven communication
- Abstract interfaces
- Message queues

**High Cohesion:**
Elements within a component should work together toward a common purpose.

**Types of Cohesion:**
```
Functional Cohesion: Elements contribute to single task (highest)
Sequential Cohesion: Output of one element is input to another
Communicational Cohesion: Elements operate on same data
Procedural Cohesion: Elements follow specific sequence
Temporal Cohesion: Elements executed at same time
Logical Cohesion: Elements perform similar functions
Coincidental Cohesion: Elements grouped arbitrarily (lowest)
```

### 2.4. Design Patterns

**Creational Patterns:**
Deal with object creation mechanisms.

**Singleton Pattern:**
Ensure a class has only one instance and provide global access to it.

**Use Cases:**
- Database connections
- Configuration managers
- Logging services
- Cache managers

**Factory Pattern:**
Create objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Builder Pattern:**
Construct complex objects step by step.

**Behavioral Patterns:**
Focus on communication between objects and assignment of responsibilities.

**Observer Pattern:**
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.

**Strategy Pattern:**
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

**Command Pattern:**
Encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests.

**Structural Patterns:**
Deal with object composition and relationships.

**Adapter Pattern:**
Allow incompatible interfaces to work together.

**Decorator Pattern:**
Add behavior to objects dynamically without altering their structure.

**Facade Pattern:**
Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### 2.5. Architectural Patterns

**Model-View-Controller (MVC):**
Separate application logic into three interconnected components.

**Components:**
```
Model: Data and business logic
View: User interface and presentation
Controller: Handles user input and coordinates Model and View

Benefits:
- Separation of concerns
- Parallel development
- Multiple views for same model
- Easier testing and maintenance
```

**Model-View-Presenter (MVP):**
Variation of MVC where the presenter handles UI logic.

**Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM):**
Uses data binding to connect View and ViewModel.

**Repository Pattern:**
Encapslate data access logic and provide a more object-oriented view of the persistence layer.

**Unit of Work Pattern:**
Maintain a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinate writing out changes.

### 2.6. Anti-Patterns

**Common Anti-Patterns:**

**God Object:**
Single class that controls too many other classes and has too many responsibilities.

**Problems:**
- Difficult to maintain and test
- High coupling with other components
- Single point of failure

**Spaghetti Code:**
Unstructured and difficult-to-maintain code with complex control flow.

**Big Ball of Mud:**
System that lacks a perceivable architecture.

**Golden Hammer:**
Over-reliance on a familiar tool or pattern for every problem.

**Premature Optimization:**
Optimizing code before identifying actual performance bottlenecks.

**Copy-Paste Programming:**
Duplicating code instead of creating reusable components.

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Code reviews and pair programming
- Refactoring and continuous improvement
- Automated testing and quality metrics
- Architectural guidelines and standards

Integration Events: Cross-system communication
Command Events: Request for action

Event Structure:
- Event ID: Unique identifier
- Event Type: Classification of event
- Timestamp: When event occurred
- Payload: Event data and context
```

**Event Processing Patterns:**
- **Event Notification**: Simple notification of occurrence
- **Event-Carried State Transfer**: Event contains state data
- **Event Sourcing**: Store all changes as events
- **CQRS**: Separate command and query responsibilities

**Benefits:**
```
Loose Coupling: Producers and consumers independent

```

### 3.5. Layered Architecture

**Traditional Layers:**
```
Presentation Layer: User interface and user interaction
Business Logic Layer: Core application functionality
Data Access Layer: Database operations and persistence
Database Layer: Data storage and management
```

**Layer Characteristics:**
- **Abstraction**: Each layer hides implementation details
- **Separation**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Dependency Direction**: Upper layers depend on lower layers
- **Communication**: Adjacent layer interaction only

**Variations:**
- **N-Tier Architecture**: Physical distribution of layers
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependency inversion with inner layers
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters pattern

### 3.6. Modern Architectural Patterns

**Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):**
- **Core Domain**: Business logic at center
- **Ports**: Interfaces for external communication
- **Adapters**: Implementations of ports for specific technologies
- **Outside-In Design**: External concerns don't affect core logic

**Onion Architecture:**
- **Concentric Layers**: Dependencies point inward
- **Domain Model**: Innermost layer with business rules
- **Application Services**: Orchestrate domain operations
- **Infrastructure**: Outermost layer with external concerns

**Clean Architecture:**
```
Entities: Enterprise business rules
Use Cases: Application business rules
Interface Adapters: Controllers, presenters, gateways
Frameworks and Drivers: External interfaces

Dependency Rule: Source code dependencies point inward
Benefits: Framework independence, testability, UI independence
```

**Client-Server Architecture:**
- **Client**: Requests services and presents data
- **Server**: Provides services and manages resources
- **Communication**: Request-response pattern
- **Variations**: Thin client, thick client, web-based

**Peer-to-Peer Architecture:**
- **Equal Nodes**: No distinction between client and server

Challenges:
- Cold start latency
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited execution time
- Debugging complexity
```

## 4. Capacity Estimation & Planning

Capacity estimation involves calculating the resources needed to meet system requirements and handle expected load while maintaining performance targets.

### 4.1. Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations

**Common Estimation Units:**
```
Time Units:
1 second = 1,000 milliseconds = 1,000,000 microseconds
1 minute = 60 seconds
1 hour = 3,600 seconds
1 day = 86,400 seconds
1 month ≈ 2.6 million seconds
1 year ≈ 31.5 million seconds

Data Units:
1 KB = 1,024 bytes ≈ 10^3 bytes
1 MB = 1,024 KB ≈ 10^6 bytes
1 GB = 1,024 MB ≈ 10^9 bytes
1 TB = 1,024 GB ≈ 10^12 bytes
1 PB = 1,024 TB ≈ 10^15 bytes
```

**Performance Numbers:**
```
L1 cache reference: 0.5 ns
Branch mispredict: 5 ns
L2 cache reference: 7 ns
Mutex lock/unlock: 100 ns
Main memory reference: 100 ns
Send 1K bytes over 1 Gbps network: 10,000 ns
Read 4K randomly from SSD: 150,000 ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from memory: 250,000 ns
Round trip within same datacenter: 500,000 ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD: 1,000,000 ns
Disk seek: 10,000,000 ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from disk: 20,000,000 ns
Send packet CA→Netherlands→CA: 150,000,000 ns
```

### 4.2. Load and Traffic Estimation

**User Traffic Patterns:**
```
Daily Active Users (DAU): Users active per day
Monthly Active Users (MAU): Users active per month
Peak to Average Ratio: Typically 2x to 10x
Geographic Distribution: Users across time zones
Seasonal Variations: Holiday spikes, weekend patterns
```

**Request Rate Calculations:**
```
Average QPS = Total Daily Requests / 86,400 seconds
Peak QPS = Average QPS × Peak Factor

Example:
1 million DAU, each user makes 10 requests/day
Average QPS = (1M × 10) / 86,400 ≈ 116 QPS
Peak QPS = 116 × 5 = 580 QPS (assuming 5x peak factor)
```

**Read/Write Ratio:**
```
Read-Heavy Systems: 100:1 to 1000:1 (social media, news)
Write-Heavy Systems: 1:1 to 1:10 (logging, analytics)
Balanced Systems: 10:1 to 50:1 (e-commerce, forums)

Impact on Design:
- Read replicas for read-heavy systems
- Write optimization for write-heavy systems
- Caching strategies based on ratio
```

### 4.3. Storage Estimation

**Data Size Calculations:**
```
Text Data:
- ASCII character: 1 byte
- Unicode character: 2-4 bytes
- Tweet (280 chars): ~560 bytes
- Average web page: 1-2 MB
- Email: 75 KB average

Media Data:
- Thumbnail image: 5-20 KB
- Full-resolution photo: 200 KB - 2 MB
- HD video (1 minute): 50-100 MB
- 4K video (1 minute): 200-400 MB
```

**Storage Growth Estimation:**
```
Daily Storage Growth = Daily New Data × Average Data Size
Annual Storage = Daily Growth × 365 × Growth Factor

Example - Photo sharing service:
1M photos uploaded daily
Average photo size: 500 KB
Daily growth: 1M × 500 KB = 500 GB/day
Annual growth: 500 GB × 365 ≈ 180 TB/year

With metadata and backups (3x factor):
Total annual storage: 180 TB × 3 = 540 TB/year
```

**Database Storage Considerations:**
```
Data Storage: Actual user data
Indexes: 10-30% of data size for efficient queries
Metadata: System data, logs, configurations
Backups: Full and incremental backup storage
Replication: Multiple copies for availability
Compression: Can reduce storage by 30-70%
```

### 4.4. Bandwidth Requirements

**Bandwidth Calculations:**
```
Bandwidth = Data Size × Request Rate

Upload Bandwidth:
Average upload rate × Number of concurrent uploads
Peak upload bandwidth = Average × Peak factor

Download Bandwidth:
Average download size × Download request rate
CDN can significantly reduce origin bandwidth
```

**Network Capacity Planning:**
```
Internal Network:
- Database replication traffic
- Inter-service communication
- Backup and synchronization

External Network:
- User-facing traffic
- API calls from external services
- CDN synchronization

Example:
1M daily users, average session 10 minutes
Peak concurrent users: 50,000
Average page size: 1 MB
Peak bandwidth: 50,000 × 1 MB / 600s ≈ 83 MB/s
```

### 4.5. Concurrent Users and QPS

**Concurrent User Estimation:**
```
Concurrent Users = DAU × (Average Session Time / 24 hours)

Example:
1M DAU with 30-minute average session
Concurrent Users = 1M × (30 min / 1440 min) ≈ 21,000

Peak Concurrent Users = Average × Peak Factor
Peak = 21,000 × 3 = 63,000 concurrent users
```

**QPS to Concurrent Users Relationship:**
```
Little's Law: L = λ × W
L = Average concurrent requests
λ = Request arrival rate (QPS)
W = Average response time

If average response time is 200ms:
QPS = Concurrent Requests / 0.2 seconds
1000 QPS = 200 concurrent requests
```

**Scaling Calculations:**
```
Servers Required = Peak QPS / QPS per Server

Example:
Peak QPS: 10,000
Server capacity: 1,000 QPS each
Servers needed: 10,000 / 1,000 = 10 servers
With redundancy (2x): 20 servers total
```

### 4.6. Resource Planning and Cost Estimation

**Server Resource Estimation:**
```
CPU Requirements:
- CPU-intensive: Image processing, encryption
- Memory-intensive: Caching, in-memory databases
- I/O-intensive: File serving, database operations

Memory Requirements:
- Application memory: JVM heap, application state
- Caching memory: Redis, Memcached
- OS and buffer memory: System overhead

Storage Requirements:
- Database storage: User data, indexes
- File storage: Images, documents, logs
- Backup storage: Multiple backup copies
```

**Cost Estimation Framework:**
```
Infrastructure Costs:
- Server costs (CPU, memory, storage)
- Network bandwidth costs
- Database hosting costs
- CDN and caching costs

Operational Costs:
- Personnel costs (development, operations)
- Third-party services (monitoring, security)
- Licensing costs (software, databases)
- Facility costs (data center, power, cooling)

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):
TCO = Infrastructure + Operational + Management + Opportunity Costs
```

**Growth Projection:**
```
Linear Growth: Steady increase over time
Exponential Growth: Rapid acceleration (viral products)
Seasonal Growth: Periodic spikes and valleys
Step Growth: Sudden increases due to events

Planning Considerations:
- Provision for 2-3x current capacity
- Plan capacity increases 6-12 months ahead
- Consider economies of scale
- Account for redundancy and failover capacity
```

## 5. Performance & Scalability

Performance and scalability are critical aspects of system design that determine how well a system handles increasing load while maintaining acceptable response times and resource utilization.

### 5.1. Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):**
Adding more machines to the pool of resources to handle increased load.

**Advantages:**
```
Linear Scalability: Add capacity incrementally
Fault Tolerance: No single point of failure
Cost Effectiveness: Use commodity hardware
Geographic Distribution: Deploy across regions
Load Distribution: Spread load across multiple nodes
```

**Challenges:**
```
Complexity: Distributed system management
Data Consistency: Maintaining consistency across nodes
Network Latency: Communication overhead between nodes
Load Balancing: Distribute requests efficiently
Session Management: Handle user sessions across nodes
```

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):**
Adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage) to existing machines.

**Advantages:**
```
Simplicity: Single machine architecture
No Distribution Complexity: Avoid distributed system issues
Consistency: Single source of truth
Performance: No network latency for inter-component communication
```

**Limitations:**
```
Hardware Limits: Physical constraints on upgrades
Single Point of Failure: Complete system failure if machine fails
Cost: Exponential cost increase for high-end hardware
Downtime: Requires system restart for upgrades
```

**Scaling Decision Matrix:**
```
Choose Horizontal Scaling When:
- Load increases unpredictably
- Geographic distribution needed
- High availability requirements
- Cost-sensitive applications

Choose Vertical Scaling When:
- Consistent, predictable load
- Strong consistency requirements
- Simple architecture preferred
- Limited development resources
```

### 5.2. Load Balancing Strategies

**Load Balancing Benefits:**
- Distribute requests across multiple servers
- Improve response times and throughput
- Provide redundancy and fault tolerance
- Enable horizontal scaling

**Load Distribution Algorithms:**
```
Round Robin: Requests distributed sequentially
Weighted Round Robin: Consider server capacity differences
Least Connections: Route to server with fewest active connections
Least Response Time: Route to fastest responding server
IP Hash: Consistent routing based on client IP
Resource-Based: Consider CPU, memory utilization
```

**Performance Impact:**
```
Throughput = Sum of individual server throughput
Response Time = Min(server response times) + load balancer overhead
Availability = 1 - Product of individual server downtime probabilities

Load Balancer Overhead: 1-5ms additional latency
```

### 5.3. Caching for Performance

**Caching Benefits:**
```
Reduced Latency: Serve data from fast storage
Decreased Load: Reduce backend system load
Improved Throughput: Handle more requests with same resources
Cost Reduction: Reduce expensive operations (database queries, API calls)
```

**Cache Hierarchy:**
```
L1: CPU Cache (nanoseconds)
L2: Application Memory (microseconds)
L3: Local Distributed Cache (milliseconds)
L4: Remote Cache (tens of milliseconds)
L5: Database (hundreds of milliseconds)
```

**Cache Hit Ratio Optimization:**
```
Cache Hit Ratio = Cache Hits / (Cache Hits + Cache Misses)
Response Time = Hit_Ratio × Cache_Latency + (1 - Hit_Ratio) × Backend_Latency

Example:
90% hit ratio, 1ms cache, 100ms backend
Response Time = 0.9 × 1ms + 0.1 × 100ms = 10.9ms
vs. 100ms without cache (90% improvement)
```

### 5.4. Database Scaling Strategies

**Read Scaling:**
```
Read Replicas: Multiple read-only database copies
Master-Slave Replication: Writes to master, reads from slaves
Read-to-Write Ratio: Determines number of read replicas needed

Replica Lag Considerations:
- Asynchronous replication introduces lag
- Eventually consistent reads
- Read preferences (primary vs. secondary)
```

**Write Scaling:**
```
Database Sharding: Partition data across multiple databases
Vertical Partitioning: Split tables by columns
Horizontal Partitioning: Split tables by rows
Federation: Split databases by function
```

**Connection Management:**
```
Connection Pooling: Reuse database connections
Pool Size Optimization: Balance resource usage and performance
Connection Lifecycle: Creation, validation, cleanup

Optimal Pool Size = ((Core Count × 2) + Effective Spindle Count)
Effective Spindle Count = Number of disks in RAID array
```

### 5.5. Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

**CDN Architecture:**
```
Origin Server: Source of original content
Edge Servers: Geographically distributed cache servers
Points of Presence (PoP): CDN server locations
DNS Routing: Direct users to nearest edge server
```

**Performance Benefits:**
```
Reduced Latency: Content served from nearby locations
Bandwidth Offloading: Reduce origin server load
Improved Availability: Multiple copies of content
DDoS Protection: Absorb and filter malicious traffic

Latency Reduction:
Speed of Light: ~300,000 km/s in fiber
Round-trip latency = 2 × Distance / Speed of Light
NYC to London: ~70ms round trip
CDN can reduce to <20ms with edge servers
```

**CDN Optimization Strategies:**
- Static content caching (images, CSS, JavaScript)
- Dynamic content acceleration
- API response caching
- Video streaming optimization

### 5.6. Auto-scaling and Elasticity

**Auto-scaling Metrics:**
```
CPU Utilization: Scale based on processor usage
Memory Usage: Scale based on memory consumption
Request Rate: Scale based on incoming requests
Response Time: Scale based on latency thresholds
Queue Length: Scale based on pending work
```

**Scaling Policies:**
```
Scale-Out Policy:
IF CPU > 80% FOR 5 minutes THEN add 1 instance
IF Request_Rate > 1000 RPS THEN add instances

Scale-In Policy:
IF CPU < 30% FOR 10 minutes THEN remove 1 instance
Cooldown periods prevent thrashing
```

**Elasticity Patterns:**
```
Proactive Scaling: Scale based on predicted demand
Reactive Scaling: Scale based on current metrics
Scheduled Scaling: Scale based on time patterns
Predictive Scaling: Use machine learning for scaling decisions

Scaling Time:
- Virtual machines: 2-5 minutes
- Containers: 10-30 seconds
- Serverless functions: Milliseconds
```

## 6. Database Design

Database design is crucial for system performance, scalability, and maintainability. The choice of database technology and design patterns significantly impacts system capabilities.

### 6.1. Database Selection Criteria

**Selection Factors:**
```
Data Model Requirements:

Full-Text Index: Text search optimization
```

**Query Optimization:**
```
Query Execution Plan: Database's strategy for executing query
Cost-Based Optimization: Choose lowest cost execution plan
Statistics: Database statistics for optimization decisions

Optimization Techniques:
- Use appropriate indexes
- Avoid SELECT * queries
- Use LIMIT for large result sets
- Optimize JOIN operations
- Use query caching
```

**Index Performance Impact:**
```
Read Performance: Logarithmic improvement O(log n)
Write Performance: Additional overhead for index maintenance
Storage Overhead: 10-30% additional storage per index

Index Selectivity = Unique Values / Total Rows
High selectivity (>0.8): Good for indexing
Low selectivity (<0.1): May hurt performance
```

### 6.3. Database Partitioning and Sharding

**Partitioning Strategies:**

**Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding):**
Split table rows across multiple databases.

**Sharding Methods:**
```
Range-Based Sharding: Partition by value ranges
Hash-Based Sharding: Use hash function for distribution
Directory-Based Sharding: Lookup service for shard location
Composite Sharding: Combination of multiple methods

Shard Key Selection:
- High cardinality for even distribution
- Query patterns for minimal cross-shard queries
- Avoid hotspots in data access
```

**Vertical Partitioning:**
Split table columns across multiple databases.

**Benefits:**
- Reduce I/O for queries accessing subset of columns
- Separate frequently and rarely accessed data
- Isolate different access patterns

**Challenges:**
```
Cross-Shard Queries: Queries spanning multiple shards
Distributed Transactions: ACID across multiple databases
Rebalancing: Moving data as load patterns change
Complexity: Application-level sharding logic
```

### 6.4. Database Replication

**Master-Slave Replication:**
```
Master: Handles all write operations
Slaves: Handle read operations, replicate from master
Asynchronous: Slaves lag behind master
Read Scalability: Multiple slaves for read load distribution

Replication Lag = Master_Timestamp - Slave_Timestamp
Typical lag: 1-100ms depending on network and load
```

**Master-Master Replication:**
```
Multiple Masters: Each handles reads and writes
Conflict Resolution: Handle concurrent updates
Active-Active: All masters actively serving traffic
Active-Passive: One master active, others standby

Conflict Resolution Strategies:
- Last Write Wins: Use timestamps
- Application-Level: Custom conflict resolution
- Vector Clocks: Track causality
```

### 6.5. Consistency Models and Trade-offs

**ACID Properties:**
```
Atomicity: All operations in transaction succeed or fail together
Consistency: Database remains in valid state after transaction
Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
Durability: Committed transactions survive system failures

ACID Guarantees: Strong consistency, may limit scalability
```

**BASE Properties:**
```
Basically Available: System remains available
Soft State: System state may change without input
Eventually Consistent: System becomes consistent over time

BASE Trade-offs: Higher availability and scalability, weaker consistency
```

**CAP Theorem:**
```
Consistency: All nodes see same data simultaneously
Availability: System remains operational
Partition Tolerance: System continues despite network failures

CAP Theorem: Can only guarantee 2 out of 3 properties

System Types:
CP Systems: MongoDB, HBase (sacrifice availability)
AP Systems: Cassandra, DynamoDB (sacrifice consistency)
CA Systems: Traditional RDBMS (sacrifice partition tolerance)
```

### 6.6. Advanced Database Patterns

**Database Federation:**
Split databases by function rather than data.

**Benefits:**
- Isolate different services
- Reduce database load
- Technology diversity

**Polyglot Persistence:**
Use different databases for different data storage needs.

**Examples:**
```
User Profiles: Relational database for structured data
Product Catalog: Document store for flexible schema
Shopping Cart: Key-value store for session data
Recommendations: Graph database for relationships
Analytics: Column store for analytical queries
Search: Full-text search engine
```

**Database Caching Patterns:**
```
Query Result Caching: Cache query results
Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Caching: Cache object instances
Application-Level Caching: Cache computed values
Database Connection Pooling: Reuse connections

Cache Invalidation Strategies:
- Time-based (TTL)
- Write-through invalidation
- Event-based invalidation
```

## 7. Caching Strategies

Caching is a fundamental technique for improving system performance by storing frequently accessed data in fast storage layers, reducing latency and system load.

### 7.1. Cache Patterns

**Cache-Aside Pattern (Lazy Loading):**
Application manages cache directly.

```
Read Flow:
1. Check cache for data
2. If cache hit: return cached data
3. If cache miss: fetch from database
4. Store data in cache
5. Return data to application

Write Flow:
1. Write data to database
2. Invalidate cache entry
3. Next read will reload from database

Pros: Simple, cache only what's needed
Cons: Cache miss penalty, potential stale data
```

**Read-Through Cache:**
Cache sits between application and database.

```
Read Flow:
1. Application requests data from cache
2. If cache hit: return cached data
3. If cache miss: cache loads from database
4. Cache returns data to application

Advantages: Transparent to application, automatic loading
Disadvantages: Complex implementation, cache vendor lock-in
```

**Write-Through Cache:**
Cache is updated synchronously with database.

```
Write Flow:
1. Application writes to cache
2. Cache writes to database synchronously
3. Return success to application

Pros: Strong consistency, simple consistency model
Cons: Higher write latency, redundant writes
```

**Write-Behind Cache (Write-Back):**
Cache is updated immediately, database updated asynchronously.

```
Write Flow:
1. Application writes to cache
2. Return success immediately
3. Cache writes to database asynchronously

Pros: Low write latency, batch database writes
Cons: Risk of data loss, complex error handling
```

**Write-Around Cache:**
Writes go directly to database, bypassing cache.

```
Write Flow:
1. Write directly to database
2. Don't update cache
3. Cache entry invalidated or expires

Use Case: Minimize write operations to cache
Good for: Write-once, read-rarely patterns
```

### 7.2. Cache Eviction Policies

**Least Recently Used (LRU):**
Remove least recently accessed items when cache is full.

```
Implementation: Doubly-linked list + hash map
Time Complexity: O(1) for get and put operations
Space Complexity: O(capacity)

LRU Effectiveness:
- High hit rate for temporal locality
- Good for general-purpose caching
- Memory overhead for tracking access order
```

**Least Frequently Used (LFU):**
Remove least frequently accessed items.

```
Implementation: Hash map + priority queue
Time Complexity: O(log n) for operations
Use Case: Long-term access patterns

LFU vs LRU:
LFU: Better for stable access patterns
LRU: Better for changing access patterns
Hybrid: LRU-K (consider K most recent accesses)
```

**Time-To-Live (TTL):**
Items expire after specified time period.

```
Implementation: Timestamp with each cache entry
Cleanup: Lazy deletion or background process
Use Cases: Session data, API responses, computed results

TTL Strategies:
Fixed TTL: Same expiration time for all items
Sliding TTL: Reset expiration on access
Variable TTL: Different expiration based on content type
```

**Advanced Eviction Policies:**
```
Random Replacement: Remove random items (simple, surprisingly effective)
FIFO: First In, First Out (simple queue)
LIFO: Last In, First Out (stack-based)
ARC: Adaptive Replacement Cache (combination of LRU and LFU)
```

### 7.3. Cache Invalidation

**Cache Invalidation Challenges:**
"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton

**Invalidation Strategies:**

**Write-Through Invalidation:**
```
Process:
1. Update database
2. Invalidate cache entry
3. Next read loads fresh data

Pros: Strong consistency
Cons: Cache miss penalty after invalidation
```

**Event-Based Invalidation:**
```
Process:
1. Database change triggers event
2. Event handler invalidates affected cache entries
3. Asynchronous invalidation

Implementation: Message queues, event streams
Challenges: Event delivery guarantees, ordering
```

**Tag-Based Invalidation:**
```
Process:
1. Associate cache entries with tags
2. Invalidate all entries with specific tag
3. Useful for related data invalidation

Example:
User profile changes → invalidate all "user:123" tagged entries
Product update → invalidate "product:456" and "category:789" tags
```

### 7.4. Cache Warming and Pre-loading

**Cache Warming Strategies:**
```
Cold Start Problem: Empty cache leads to high latency
Warm-up Time: Time to reach optimal hit rate

Warming Approaches:
1. Pre-populate with expected data
2. Background loading of popular items
3. Gradual warming through normal traffic
4. Predictive pre-loading based on patterns
```

**Cache Warming Implementation:**
```
Scheduled Warming: Load data at off-peak hours
Event-Triggered Warming: Warm cache after deployments
Predictive Warming: Use analytics to predict needed data
User-Triggered Warming: Pre-load user-specific data on login
```

### 7.5. Distributed Caching

**Distributed Cache Architecture:**
```
Client-Side Caching: Cache at application level
Server-Side Caching: Shared cache across application instances
Multi-Level Caching: Combination of client and server caching

Consistency Challenges:
- Cache coherence across nodes
- Invalidation propagation
- Network partition handling
```

**Distributed Cache Patterns:**
```
Replication: Full copy on each cache node
Partitioning: Data distributed across cache nodes
Consistent Hashing: Minimize data movement on node changes

Cache Cluster Management:
- Node discovery and membership
- Load balancing across cache nodes
- Failover and recovery procedures
```

### 7.6. Cache Performance Optimization

**Cache Stampede Protection:**
Multiple threads/processes requesting same missing data simultaneously.

```
Problem: Thundering herd on cache miss
Solutions:
1. Lock-based: First thread loads, others wait
2. Probabilistic early expiration: Refresh before expiration
3. Background refresh: Asynchronous cache updates

Implementation:
- Distributed locks (Redis, ZooKeeper)
- Semaphores to limit concurrent loads
- Circuit breakers for failing backends
```

**Cache Sizing and Tuning:**
```
Cache Hit Rate Optimization:
Hit Rate = Cache Hits / (Cache Hits + Cache Misses)

Working Set Size: Amount of data actively accessed
Cache Size Guidelines:
- Start with 10-20% of working set size
- Monitor hit rates and adjust
- Consider memory constraints

Performance Metrics:
- Hit rate (target: >80-90%)
- Average response time
- Cache utilization
- Eviction rate
```

**Multi-Level Caching:**
```
L1: In-process cache (fastest, smallest)
L2: Local distributed cache (Redis, Memcached)
L3: CDN cache (geographic distribution)
L4: Database query cache

Cache Hierarchy Benefits:
- Minimize expensive operations
- Optimize for different access patterns
- Balance speed vs. capacity
```

## 8. Load Balancing

- High cost and complexity

Examples: F5 BIG-IP, Citrix NetScaler, A10 Networks
Use Cases: Enterprise environments, high-throughput applications
```

**Software Load Balancers:**
```
Characteristics:
- Software running on commodity hardware
- Lower cost and greater flexibility

- Pay-as-you-use pricing
```

### 8.2. Load Balancing Algorithms

**Round Robin:**
Distribute requests sequentially across available servers.

```
Implementation:
servers = [server1, server2, server3]
current_index = 0

def get_next_server():
    server = servers[current_index]
    current_index = (current_index + 1) % len(servers)
    return server

Pros: Simple, fair distribution
Cons: Doesn't consider server capacity or current load
```

**Weighted Round Robin:**
Assign weights to servers based on their capacity.

```
Implementation:
servers = [
    {"server": server1, "weight": 3},
    {"server": server2, "weight": 2},
    {"server": server3, "weight": 1}
]

Distribution: server1 gets 50%, server2 gets 33%, server3 gets 17%
Use Case: Servers with different capacities
```

**Least Connections:**
Route requests to server with fewest active connections.

```
Algorithm:
1. Track active connections per server
2. Select server with minimum connections
3. Increment connection count
4. Decrement count when connection closes

Effectiveness: Better for long-lived connections
Overhead: Requires connection tracking
```

**Least Response Time:**
Route to server with fastest response time.

```
Implementation:
1. Monitor server response times
2. Maintain moving average of response times
3. Route to server with lowest average response time

Metrics:
Response_Time_Average = (α × Current_Response_Time) + ((1-α) × Previous_Average)
where α is smoothing factor (typically 0.1-0.3)
```

**IP Hash:**
Use client IP address to determine server assignment.

```
Algorithm:
server_index = hash(client_ip) % number_of_servers

Benefits:
- Session persistence without server state
- Consistent routing for same client
- Simple implementation

Drawbacks:
- Uneven distribution if client IPs clustered
- Difficulty handling server failures
```

### 8.3. Health Checking and Monitoring

**Health Check Types:**
```
TCP Health Checks: Verify server accepts connections
HTTP Health Checks: Send HTTP requests, verify responses
Application Health Checks: Test application-specific functionality
Deep Health Checks: Verify database connectivity, dependencies

Health Check Configuration:
- Interval: How often to check (e.g., every 30 seconds)
- Timeout: Maximum time to wait for response
- Threshold: Number of consecutive failures before marking unhealthy
- Recovery: Number of consecutive successes to mark healthy
```

**Health Check Implementation:**
```
Health Check State Machine:
Healthy → Unhealthy: After N consecutive failures
Unhealthy → Healthy: After M consecutive successes

Example Configuration:
interval: 30s
timeout: 5s
unhealthy_threshold: 3
healthy_threshold: 2

Failure Detection Time: interval × unhealthy_threshold = 90s
Recovery Time: interval × healthy_threshold = 60s
```

### 8.4. Session Persistence and SSL Termination

**Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions):**
```
Cookie-Based Persistence: Use application cookies
IP-Based Persistence: Route based on client IP
Server-Generated Persistence: Load balancer generates session ID

Trade-offs:
Pros: Simple application design, server state maintained
Cons: Uneven load distribution, server failure handling complexity

Alternative: Stateless applications with shared session storage
```

**SSL Termination:**
Load balancer handles SSL encryption/decryption.

```
SSL Termination Benefits:
- Offload CPU-intensive operations from application servers
- Centralized certificate management
- Simplified application server configuration
- Better performance monitoring

SSL Termination Types:
SSL Bridging: Decrypt and re-encrypt to backend
SSL Passthrough: Forward encrypted traffic to backend
SSL Offloading: Decrypt and send plain HTTP to backend
```

### 8.5. Global Load Balancing

**DNS Load Balancing:**
Use DNS to distribute traffic geographically.

```
DNS Round Robin: Return different IP addresses
Geographic DNS: Return IPs based on client location
Weighted DNS: Return IPs based on server weights

DNS Considerations:
TTL: Controls how long DNS records are cached
Failover: Automatic removal of failed servers
Health Checks: Integration with server monitoring
```

**Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB):**
```
Architecture:
- Local load balancers in each data center
- Global load balancer routes between data centers
- Health monitoring across all locations

Routing Decisions:
- Geographic proximity
- Server health and capacity
- Network conditions
- Cost considerations

Benefits:
- Disaster recovery capabilities

Active-Passive: Primary LB with standby backup
Active-Active: Multiple active load balancers

Load Balancer as Bottleneck:
Signs: High CPU/memory usage, increased latency
Solutions: Scale load balancer tier, optimize algorithms
Monitoring: Track load balancer performance metrics
```

## 9. API Design

API design is crucial for system integration, defining how different components and external systems interact with your application through well-defined interfaces.

### 9.1. RESTful APIs

**REST Principles:**
```
Representational State Transfer (REST) Constraints:
1. Client-Server Architecture: Separation of concerns
2. Stateless: Each request contains all necessary information
3. Cacheable: Responses can be cached for performance
4. Uniform Interface: Consistent resource identification
5. Layered System: Hierarchical system architecture
6. Code on Demand: Optional client-side code execution
```

**HTTP Methods and Semantics:**
```
GET: Retrieve resource (idempotent, safe)
POST: Create new resource or process data
PUT: Create or replace entire resource (idempotent)
PATCH: Partial resource update (not necessarily idempotent)
DELETE: Remove resource (idempotent)
HEAD: Get resource metadata only
OPTIONS: Get allowed methods for resource

Idempotency: Multiple identical requests have same effect
Safety: Request doesn't modify server state
```

**RESTful URL Design:**
```
Resource-Based URLs:
/users - Collection of users
/users/123 - Specific user
/users/123/posts - User's posts
/users/123/posts/456 - Specific user's post

Best Practices:
- Use nouns, not verbs in URLs
- Use plural nouns for collections
- Use hyphens for readability
- Keep URLs simple and intuitive
- Version APIs appropriately
```

**HTTP Status Codes:**
```
Success (2xx):
200 OK: Request successful
201 Created: Resource created successfully
202 Accepted: Request accepted for processing
204 No Content: Successful request with no response body

Client Errors (4xx):
400 Bad Request: Invalid request syntax
401 Unauthorized: Authentication required
403 Forbidden: Access denied
404 Not Found: Resource not found
409 Conflict: Request conflicts with current state
429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded

Server Errors (5xx):
500 Internal Server Error: Generic server error
502 Bad Gateway: Invalid response from upstream
503 Service Unavailable: Server temporarily unavailable
504 Gateway Timeout: Upstream server timeout
```

### 9.2. GraphQL

**GraphQL Core Concepts:**
```

Type System: Strongly typed schema definition
Resolvers: Functions that fetch data for each field

Benefits:
- Reduce over-fetching and under-fetching
- Single request for complex data requirements
- Strong type system and introspection
- Real-time subscriptions support
```

**GraphQL Operations:**
```

    }
  }
}

Mutation: Modify data (equivalent to POST/PUT/DELETE)
mutation {
  createUser(input: {name: "John", email: "john@example.com"}) {
    id

  }
}

Subscription: Real-time data updates
subscription {
  messageAdded(channel: "general") {

    content
    user
  }
}
```

**GraphQL vs REST:**
```
GraphQL Advantages:
- Single endpoint for all operations
- Client-specified data fetching
- Strong type system
- Real-time subscriptions
- Introspection capabilities

REST Advantages:

```

**Rate Limiting Algorithms:**
```
Token Bucket: Tokens added at fixed rate, consumed per request
Leaky Bucket: Requests processed at steady rate
Fixed Window: Fixed number of requests per time window
Sliding Window: Rolling time window for rate calculation

Token Bucket Implementation:
tokens = min(capacity, tokens + (time_elapsed × refill_rate))
if tokens >= 1:
    tokens -= 1
    allow_request()
else:
    reject_request()
```

**API Security Best Practices:**
```
HTTPS Only: Encrypt all API communications
Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all inputs
Output Encoding: Encode outputs to prevent XSS
SQL Injection Prevention: Use parameterized queries
CORS Configuration: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
Security Headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options
Audit Logging: Log all API access and modifications
```

### 9.6. API Design Best Practices

**Request Validation:**
```
Schema Validation: Validate request structure
Data Type Validation: Ensure correct data types
Business Rule Validation: Enforce business constraints
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse and overload

Example Validation:
{
  "name": {
    "type": "string",
    "minLength": 1,
    "maxLength": 100,
    "required": true
  },
  "email": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "email",
    "required": true
  }
}
```

**Response Formatting:**
```
Consistent Structure: Standard response format
Error Responses: Clear error messages and codes
Metadata: Include pagination, timing information
Content Negotiation: Support multiple response formats

Standard Response Format:
{
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "version": "1.0",
    "total": 100,
    "page": 1
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

**Pagination Strategies:**
```
Offset-Based Pagination:
GET /users?page=2&limit=20
- Simple implementation
- Performance degrades with large offsets

Cursor-Based Pagination:
GET /users?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ&limit=20
- Consistent performance
- Handles real-time data changes better

Link Header Pagination:
Link: <https://api.example.com/users?page=2>; rel="next",
      <https://api.example.com/users?page=5>; rel="last"
```

**HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State):**
```
Concept: Include links to related resources in responses
Benefits: Self-documenting API, client navigation guidance
Implementation: Include relevant URLs in response

Example:
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "_links": {
    "self": "/users/123",
    "posts": "/users/123/posts",
    "edit": "/users/123",
    "delete": "/users/123"
  }
}

```
Message Routing: Direct messages to appropriate consumers
Message Transformation: Convert message formats
Message Persistence: Store messages for reliability
Load Balancing: Distribute messages across consumers
Protocol Bridging: Connect different messaging protocols
Monitoring: Track message flow and system health
```

**Publish-Subscribe Pattern:**
```
Components:
Publisher: Sends messages to topics
Subscriber: Receives messages from topics
Topic: Named channel for message distribution
Message Broker: Manages topics and message routing

Benefits:
- Loose coupling between producers and consumers
- One-to-many message distribution
- Dynamic subscription management
- Scalable message distribution

Use Cases: Event notifications, real-time updates, broadcast messaging
```

**Point-to-Point Messaging:**
```
Components:

- No duplicate messages
- Lowest latency and overhead
- Best effort delivery

Use Cases: Metrics, logs, non-critical notifications
Performance: Highest throughput, lowest latency
```

**At-Least-Once Delivery:**
```
Guarantee: Each message delivered one or more times
Implementation: Send message, wait for acknowledgment, retry on failure
Characteristics:
- No message loss
- Possible duplicate messages
- Higher latency due to acknowledgments
- Requires idempotent message processing

Use Cases: Financial transactions, order processing, critical notifications
Implementation: Message IDs, deduplication logic, acknowledgment protocols
```

**Exactly-Once Delivery:**
```
Guarantee: Each message delivered exactly one time
Implementation: Complex coordination between producer, broker, and consumer

Backpressure Strategies:
1. Block Producer: Stop accepting new messages
2. Drop Messages: Discard excess messages (at-most-once)
3. Buffer Messages: Queue messages in memory (limited capacity)
4. Push Back: Signal producer to slow down
5. Load Shedding: Drop low-priority messages

Implementation:
- Queue size limits

- Advanced: Biometric + Hardware token
```

**Password-Based Authentication:**
```
Password Security Requirements:
- Minimum length (8-12+ characters)
- Character complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- No common patterns or dictionary words
- Regular password rotation policies
- Account lockout after failed attempts

Password Storage:
- Never store passwords in plaintext
- Use cryptographically secure hashing
- Add salt to prevent rainbow table attacks
- Use slow hashing algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2)

bcrypt Example:
hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12))
- Cost factor (rounds) determines computation time
- Higher rounds = more secure but slower
```

**Token-Based Authentication:**
```
Session Tokens:
- Server generates unique token after login
- Client includes token in subsequent requests
- Server validates token for each request
- Token stored in secure HTTP-only cookies

API Keys:
- Long-lived credentials for service authentication
- Should be kept secret and rotated regularly
- Include rate limiting and scope restrictions
- Monitor usage patterns for anomalies
```

Grant Types:
1. Authorization Code: Web applications (most secure)
2. Implicit: Single-page applications (deprecated)
3. Resource Owner Password: Trusted applications only
4. Client Credentials: Service-to-service communication

Authorization Code Flow:
1. Client redirects user to authorization server
2. User authenticates and grants permission
3. Authorization server redirects back with code
4. Client exchanges code for access token
5. Client uses token to access protected resources
```

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**
```
Structure: Header.Payload.Signature
- Header: Token type and signing algorithm
- Payload: Claims about user and token
- Signature: Ensures token integrity

JWT Claims:
iss: Issuer (who created the token)
sub: Subject (who the token is about)
aud: Audience (who the token is for)
exp: Expiration time
iat: Issued at time
nbf: Not before time

JWT Benefits:
- Stateless: No server-side session storage
- Self-contained: All info in the token
- Cross-domain: Works across different domains
- Standards-based: Well-defined specification

JWT Security Considerations:
- Use HTTPS only
- Short expiration times
- Secure storage on client side

- Key distribution challenge

Asymmetric: Different keys for encryption/decryption (RSA, ECC)
- Slower, suitable for key exchange and digital signatures
- Solves key distribution problem
```

**Hashing and Digital Signatures:**
```
Cryptographic Hash Functions:
- One-way functions: Easy to compute, hard to reverse

- Stored separately from hash
- Same pepper for all passwords
- Additional layer of security
```

### 13.4. Access Control Models

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
```
Components:
- Users: Individuals or service accounts
- Roles: Collections of permissions
- Permissions: Specific access rights to resources
- Role Assignment: Mapping users to roles

RBAC Hierarchy:
- Role hierarchies with inheritance
- Senior roles inherit junior role permissions
- Simplifies permission management
- Reduces administrative overhead

Example RBAC Structure:
Users: Alice, Bob, Charlie
Roles: Admin, Editor, Viewer
Permissions: Read, Write, Delete
Assignments: Alice→Admin, Bob→Editor, Charlie→Viewer
```

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
```
Components:
- Subject Attributes: User department, clearance level
- Resource Attributes: Data classification, owner
- Environment Attributes: Time, location, network
- Action Attributes: Read, write, execute

ABAC Policy Example:
Allow if:
  subject.department == "Finance" AND
  resource.classification == "Internal" AND
  environment.time >= "09:00" AND
  environment.time <= "17:00"

ABAC Benefits:
- Fine-grained access control
- Dynamic policy evaluation
- Context-aware decisions
- Flexible policy definition

ABAC Challenges:
- Complex policy management
- Performance overhead
- Difficult to debug
- Higher implementation complexity
```

### 13.5. Web Security

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
```
Same-Origin Policy: Browser security feature

- Blocks cross-origin requests by default
- Prevents malicious site access to sensitive data

CORS Headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Specifies allowed origins
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Allowed HTTP methods
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Allowed request headers
Access-Control-Max-Age: Preflight cache duration

CORS Preflight:
1. Browser sends OPTIONS request for complex requests
2. Server responds with allowed methods/headers
3. Browser sends actual request if allowed
4. Server responds with actual data
```

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:**
```
CSRF Attack: Malicious site makes requests on behalf of authenticated user
Prevention Methods:
1. CSRF Tokens: Unique token per form/session
2. SameSite Cookies: Restrict cross-site cookie sending
3. Double Submit Cookies: Compare cookie and header values
4. Referer Header Validation: Check request origin

CSRF Token Implementation:
1. Server generates random token per session
2. Token included in forms as hidden field
3. Server validates token on form submission
4. Reject requests with invalid/missing tokens
```

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:**
```
XSS Types:
- Stored XSS: Malicious script stored in database
- Reflected XSS: Script reflected from request parameters
- DOM-based XSS: Client-side script manipulation

XSS Prevention:
1. Input Validation: Whitelist valid input patterns
2. Output Encoding: Encode data before display
3. Content Security Policy (CSP): Restrict script sources
4. HTTP-only Cookies: Prevent script access to cookies

Content Security Policy Example:
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
- Restricts resource loading to same origin
- Allows inline scripts (not recommended)
```

**SQL Injection Prevention:**
```
SQL Injection: Malicious SQL code in application inputs
Example: ' OR '1'='1' -- drops password check

Prevention Methods:
1. Parameterized Queries: Use prepared statements
2. Stored Procedures: Pre-compiled SQL code
3. Input Validation: Whitelist valid input patterns
4. Least Privilege: Limit database user permissions

Parameterized Query Example:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
execute(query, [username, password])
- Parameters separated from SQL code
- Database engine handles parameter sanitization
```

### 13.6. DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting

**DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attacks:**
```
Attack Types:
- Volume-based: Overwhelm bandwidth (UDP floods)
- Protocol-based: Exploit protocol weaknesses (SYN floods)
- Application-based: Target application resources (HTTP floods)

DDoS Protection Strategies:

2. Traffic Filtering: Block malicious traffic patterns
3. Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across servers
4. CDN/Anycast: Absorb traffic at edge locations
5. Auto-scaling: Add capacity during attacks

Blackhole Routing: Route attack traffic to null routes
Scrubbing Centers: Clean traffic before forwarding to origin
```

**Rate Limiting Implementation:**
```
Rate Limiting Algorithms:
1. Token Bucket: Tokens added at fixed rate
2. Leaky Bucket: Process requests at steady rate
3. Fixed Window: Count requests in time windows
4. Sliding Window: Rolling time window

Token Bucket Algorithm:
bucket_capacity = 100
refill_rate = 10 per second
tokens = min(capacity, tokens + elapsed_time * refill_rate)
if tokens >= 1:
    tokens -= 1
    allow_request()
else:
    reject_request()

```

## 14. Monitoring & Observability

Monitoring and observability provide visibility into system behavior, performance, and health, enabling proactive issue detection and resolution.

### 14.1. The Three Pillars of Observability

**Metrics:**
```
Time-series data points with timestamps
Types:
- Counter: Monotonically increasing values (requests served, errors)
- Gauge: Point-in-time values (CPU usage, memory consumption)
- Histogram: Distribution of values (response time percentiles)
- Summary: Pre-calculated percentiles and counts

Key Metrics Categories:
Business Metrics: Revenue, user signups, feature usage
Application Metrics: Response time, error rate, throughput
Infrastructure Metrics: CPU, memory, disk, network
```

**Logs:**
```
Structured event records with timestamps
Log Levels:
- DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic information
- INFO: General application flow
- WARN: Potentially harmful situations
- ERROR: Error events that don't stop application
- FATAL: Severe errors that might abort application

Structured Logging Example:
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
  "session_id": "abc123"
}

Log Aggregation: Centralize logs from all services
Log Correlation: Connect related log entries across services
```

**Traces:**
```
Request journey through distributed system
Trace Components:
- Trace: Complete request path
- Span: Individual operation within trace
- Tags: Key-value metadata
- Logs: Timestamped events within spans

Distributed Tracing Benefits:
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Understand service dependencies
- Debug complex distributed issues
- Optimize critical paths

Trace Context Propagation:
X-Trace-Id: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
X-Span-Id: 6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8
```

### 14.2. Metrics Collection and Analysis

Tail-based Sampling: Decide after trace completion
- Sample based on trace characteristics
- Keep all error traces
- More complex but better coverage

Sampling Considerations:
- Balance overhead vs. observability
- Ensure error traces are captured
- Consider trace completeness
- Monitor sampling effectiveness
```

### 14.5. Alerting Systems

**Alert Types:**
```
Threshold Alerts: Metric crosses predefined threshold
- CPU usage > 80%
- Error rate > 1%
- Response time > 500ms

Anomaly Detection: Deviation from normal patterns
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning models
- Seasonal pattern detection

Composite Alerts: Multiple conditions combined
- High error rate AND high response time
- Low throughput AND high queue length
```

**Alert Design Principles:**
```
Actionable: Alert should require human intervention
Relevant: Alert indicates real problem
Non-redundant: Avoid duplicate alerts
Timely: Alert fires quickly when problem occurs

Alert Fatigue Prevention:
- Tune thresholds to reduce false positives
- Use alert suppression during maintenance
- Implement alert correlation
- Regular alert review and cleanup

Alert Escalation:
Level 1: On-call engineer notification
Level 2: Team lead if not acknowledged

## 16. Distributed Systems Concepts

Distributed systems concepts address the fundamental challenges of building reliable, consistent, and scalable systems across multiple networked computers.

### 16.1. Consensus Algorithms

**Consensus Problem:**
```
Challenge: Multiple nodes agreeing on single value
Requirements:
- Agreement: All correct nodes decide same value
- Validity: Decided value must be proposed by some node
- Termination: All correct nodes eventually decide

Consensus Applications:
- Leader election
- State machine replication
- Atomic commitment
- Configuration management
```

**Paxos Algorithm:**
```
Paxos Roles:
- Proposer: Proposes values
- Acceptor: Votes on proposed values
- Learner: Learns chosen value

Paxos Phases:
Phase 1 (Prepare): Proposer sends prepare(n) to acceptors
Phase 2 (Accept): Proposer sends accept(n, v) to acceptors

Paxos Properties:
- Safety: At most one value chosen
- Liveness: Some value eventually chosen (with majority)
- Fault Tolerance: Works with f failures out of 2f+1 nodes

Multi-Paxos: Optimization for multiple consensus instances
- Eliminate Phase 1 for stable leader
- Higher throughput for sequence of decisions
```

**Raft Consensus:**
```
Raft Components:
- Leader Election: Select single leader per term
- Log Replication: Leader replicates entries to followers
- Safety: Ensure consistency across all nodes

Raft States:
- Follower: Accepts entries from leader
- Candidate: Seeks votes for leadership
- Leader: Handles client requests, replicates log

Raft Guarantees:
- Election Safety: At most one leader per term
- Leader Append-Only: Leader never overwrites entries
- Log Matching: Identical entries in logs are identical
- Leader Completeness: Committed entries in future leader logs
- State Machine Safety: Same log index contains same command
```

### 16.2. Leader Election

**Leader Election Requirements:**
```
Uniqueness: At most one leader at any time
Liveness: Eventually a leader is elected
Fairness: Any node can become leader (optional)

Election Algorithms:
- Bully Algorithm: Highest ID wins
- Ring Algorithm: Token-based election
- Raft Election: Randomized timeouts
- Paxos-based: Consensus for leader selection
```

**Raft Leader Election:**
```
Election Process:
1. Follower timeout triggers candidate state
2. Candidate increments term, votes for self
3. Candidate requests votes from other nodes
4. Majority votes → becomes leader
5. Heartbeats maintain leadership

Election Timeout: Randomized (150-300ms)
- Prevents split votes
- Ensures eventual leader election
- Heartbeat interval << election timeout

Split Vote Handling:
- No majority → new election with higher term
- Randomized timeouts reduce probability
- Eventually one candidate wins
```

### 16.3. Distributed Transactions

**Two-Phase Commit (2PC):**
```
Participants:
- Coordinator: Manages transaction protocol
- Participants: Resources involved in transaction

Phase 1 (Prepare):
1. Coordinator sends prepare request to all participants
2. Participants prepare transaction and respond (yes/no)
3. Coordinator collects all responses

Phase 2 (Commit/Abort):
1. If all participants voted yes → send commit
2. If any participant voted no → send abort
3. Participants commit/abort and respond
4. Coordinator completes transaction

2PC Problems:
- Blocking: Participants wait for coordinator recovery
- Single point of failure at coordinator
- Performance overhead of two network rounds
```

**Saga Pattern:**
```
Saga Concept: Long-running transaction as sequence of local transactions
Each step has compensating action for rollback

Saga Types:
Choreography: Each service manages its own saga steps
Orchestration: Central coordinator manages saga

Saga Example - Order Processing:
1. Reserve Inventory → Compensate: Release Inventory
2. Charge Payment → Compensate: Refund Payment
3. Ship Order → Compensate: Cancel Shipment

Saga Benefits:
- No distributed locking
- Better availability than 2PC
- Handles long-running processes

Saga Challenges:
- Complex error handling
- Eventual consistency
- Compensating action design
```

### 16.4. Consistency Models

**Strong Consistency:**
```
Linearizability: Operations appear atomic at some point between start and completion
Sequential Consistency: All operations appear in some total order consistent with program order

Strong Consistency Benefits:
- Simple programming model
- Predictable behavior
- Easy to reason about

Strong Consistency Costs:
- Higher latency (coordination overhead)
- Lower availability (CAP theorem)
- Scalability limitations
```

**Eventual Consistency:**
```
Guarantee: System will become consistent after updates stop
Properties:
- Convergence: All replicas eventually have same value
- Termination: Update propagation eventually completes
- No ordering guarantee during inconsistent period

Eventual Consistency Examples:
- DNS propagation
- Email delivery
- Social media feeds
- Shopping cart synchronization

Implementation Patterns:
- Read Repair: Fix inconsistencies on read
- Anti-entropy: Background synchronization
- Merkle Trees: Efficient difference detection
```

**Causal Consistency:**
```
Guarantee: Causally related operations seen in same order by all processes
Causal Relationship: a → b if:
- a and b in same process and a comes before b
- a is send and b is receive of same message
- Transitivity: a → b and b → c implies a → c

Vector Clocks: Track causal relationships
- Each process maintains vector of logical clocks
- Update vector on every event
- Compare vectors to determine causality

Causal Consistency Benefits:
- Preserves intuitive ordering
- Allows concurrent operations
- More scalable than strong consistency
```

### 16.5. Conflict Resolution

**Conflict Detection:**
```
Version Vectors: Track per-replica version numbers
- Detect concurrent updates
- Determine causality relationships
- Identify conflicts automatically

Conflict Types:
- Write-Write: Multiple writers update same data
- Read-Write: Reader sees intermediate state
- Write-Read: Writer conflicts with ongoing read
```

**Conflict Resolution Strategies:**
```
Last Writer Wins (LWW): Use timestamp to resolve conflicts
- Simple but can lose data
- Requires synchronized clocks
- Good for commutative operations

Multi-Value: Keep all conflicting values
- Application resolves conflicts
- Preserves all information
- Complex for applications

Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs):
- Data structures that automatically resolve conflicts
- Commutative operations
- Examples: G-Counter, PN-Counter, OR-Set

CRDT Properties:
- Convergence: All replicas converge to same state
- Commutativity: Operation order doesn't matter
- Associativity: Grouping doesn't matter
- Idempotency: Duplicate operations safe
```

### 16.6. Distributed Coordination

**Idempotency:**
```
Definition: Multiple executions have same effect as single execution
Importance in distributed systems:
- Network failures cause retries
- Duplicate message delivery
- Partial failures and recovery

Idempotency Patterns:
- Idempotent Operations: Naturally idempotent (SET value)
- Idempotent Keys: Unique identifier per operation
- Conditional Updates: Check-and-set operations
- State Comparison: Compare current vs. desired state

Implementation Strategies:
- Database constraints (unique keys)
- Application-level deduplication
- Immutable operations
- Token-based idempotency
```

**Distributed Locking:**
```
Distributed Lock Requirements:
- Mutual Exclusion: Only one client holds lock
- Deadlock Free: System makes progress
- Fault Tolerance: Handle node failures
- Live-lock Free: Eventually acquire lock

Lock Implementation Approaches:
Database-based: Use database transactions for locking
Consensus-based: Paxos/Raft for lock coordination
Lease-based: Time-bounded lock ownership
Leader-based: Single node manages all locks

Redlock Algorithm (Redis):
1. Acquire locks on majority of Redis instances
2. Check total acquisition time < lock validity
3. If successful, use lock for operation
4. Release locks on all instances

Distributed Lock Challenges:
- Network partitions
- Clock synchronization
- Process failures
- Performance overhead
```

**Global State Management:**
```
Distributed Snapshot: Consistent global state capture
Chandy-Lamport Algorithm:
1. Process records local state
2. Sends marker on all outgoing channels
3. Records messages until marker received
4. Results in consistent distributed snapshot

Applications:
- Distributed debugging
- Checkpointing for fault tolerance
- Distributed garbage collection
- Global property detection

State Synchronization:
- Vector clocks for causality
- Logical timestamps for ordering
- Gossip protocols for dissemination
- Merkle trees for efficient sync
```

```
Redundancy: Multiple instances of critical components
- Active-Active: All instances handle traffic
- Active-Passive: Standby instances ready for failover
- N+1 Redundancy: One extra instance for failure handling
- Geographic Redundancy: Multiple data centers

Availability Calculation:
Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
where MTBF = Mean Time Between Failures
      MTTR = Mean Time To Repair

System Availability = ∏(Component_Availability_i)
for components in series

Parallel Components:
Availability = 1 - ∏(1 - Component_Availability_i)
```

**Disaster Recovery Planning:**
```
Recovery Objectives:
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Maximum acceptable downtime
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): Maximum acceptable data loss
- MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery): Average recovery time
- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures): Average operational time

DR Strategies:
Hot Site: Fully operational backup site (RTO: minutes)
Warm Site: Partially configured backup site (RTO: hours)
Cold Site: Basic infrastructure only (RTO: days)
Cloud DR: Elastic cloud-based recovery (RTO: variable)

Business Continuity:
- Critical business function identification
- Impact assessment and prioritization
- Recovery procedures and runbooks
- Regular testing and validation
```

### 19.2. Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
```
Circuit Breaker States:

- Open: Failure threshold exceeded, requests fail fast
- Half-Open: Testing recovery, limited requests allowed

Circuit Breaker Configuration:
failure_threshold = 5  # failures before opening
timeout = 60  # seconds before attempting recovery
success_threshold = 3  # successes to close circuit

Benefits:
- Prevent cascade failures
- Fail fast instead of hanging
- Give failing service time to recover
- Provide fallback mechanisms
```

**Bulkhead Pattern:**

base_delay = 100ms
multiplier = 2
max_delay = 30s

Attempts: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms, 1.6s, 3.2s, 6.4s, 12.8s, 25.6s, 30s

Jitter Addition:
jittered_delay = delay * (0.5 + random(0, 0.5))
- Prevents thundering herd problem
- Distributes retry attempts over time
- Reduces system load spikes
```

**Retry Configuration:**
```
Retry Policies:
- Max Attempts: Limit total retry count
- Timeout: Maximum time for all attempts
- Backoff Strategy: Fixed, exponential, or custom

- Cascading failure prevention
```

### 19.5. Data Consistency and Durability

**Consistency Levels:**
```
Strong Consistency:

- Immediate consistency after writes
- Higher latency due to coordination
- Examples: RDBMS with ACID properties

Eventual Consistency:
- Replicas converge over time
- Immediate availability, eventual convergence
- Lower latency, higher availability
- Examples: DNS, email, social media feeds

Causal Consistency:
- Causally related operations ordered consistently
- Concurrent operations can be ordered differently
- Balance between strong and eventual consistency
- Vector clocks for causal tracking
```

**Durability Guarantees:**
```
Replication Strategies:
- Synchronous Replication: Write to multiple replicas before ack
- Asynchronous Replication: Write locally, replicate later
- Quorum-Based: Write to majority of replicas

Persistence Mechanisms:
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL): Log changes before applying
- Checkpointing: Periodic state snapshots
- Transaction Logs: Ordered record of all changes
