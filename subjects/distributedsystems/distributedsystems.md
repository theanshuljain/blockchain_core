# Foundations & Basic Concepts

## Definition of Distributed Systems
A **distributed system** is a collection of **autonomous computing elements** that appears to its users as a **single coherent system**.

### Key Components
- **Autonomous computing elements**: Independent nodes (computers, processes, threads)
- **Communication network**: Interconnects nodes for message passing
- **Middleware**: Software layer providing common services and abstractions
- **Single system image**: Users perceive the system as unified

### Formal Definition
A distributed system consists of:
```
DS = (N, C, M, A)
where:
N = Set of nodes (computing elements)
C = Communication network
M = Middleware layer
A = Applications running on the system
```

## Characteristics of Distributed Systems

### Concurrency
**Multiple processes** execute simultaneously across different nodes.
- **Parallel execution**: Tasks run concurrently on different processors
- **Resource sharing**: Multiple processes access shared resources
- **Race conditions**: Require synchronization mechanisms
- **Deadlock prevention**: Careful resource allocation strategies

### No Global Clock
**Absence of global time** creates ordering and synchronization challenges.
- **Logical clocks**: Lamport timestamps, vector clocks
- **Causal ordering**: Happens-before relationships
- **Clock synchronization**: Network Time Protocol (NTP), Precision Time Protocol
- **Event ordering**: Total vs. partial ordering of events

### Independent Failures
**Components fail independently** without affecting the entire system.
- **Partial failures**: Some nodes fail while others continue operating
- **Failure detection**: Heartbeat mechanisms, timeout-based detection
- **Fault isolation**: Prevent failure propagation
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality

### Heterogeneity
**Diverse hardware and software** components coexist in the system.
- **Hardware diversity**: Different CPU architectures, operating systems

# Communication in Distributed Systems

## Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

### RPC Fundamentals
**Remote Procedure Call** allows programs to execute procedures on remote machines as if they were local calls.

#### Core Concept
**Transparency goal**: Make remote calls appear like local procedure calls.

**Basic RPC Model**:
```
Client Process          Server Process
    |                        |
call foo(args)               |
    |                        |
    v                        |
Client Stub                  |
    |                        |
marshal args                 |
send request -----------> Server Stub
    |                        |
wait for reply               unmarshal args
    |                        |
    ^                        v
unmarshal result        call foo(args)
    |                        |
return result                return result
    ^                        |
receive reply <---------- marshal result
                        send reply
```

#### RPC Components
- **Client**: Initiates remote procedure call
- **Client stub**: Local proxy for remote procedure
- **RPC runtime**: Handles network communication
- **Server stub**: Remote proxy that calls actual procedure
- **Server**: Implements the actual procedure

### Marshalling and Unmarshalling
**Data serialization** for network transmission between heterogeneous systems.

#### Marshalling Process
**Convert data structures** into network-transmissible format.

**Challenges**:
- **Data representation**: Different byte ordering (endianness)
- **Type sizes**: Varying integer and pointer sizes
- **Alignment**: Different memory alignment requirements
- **Character encoding**: ASCII, UTF-8, EBCDIC differences

#### Marshalling Techniques

**Fixed-length Encoding**:
- **Simple implementation**: Predefined field sizes
- **Efficient parsing**: Fixed offsets for data fields
- **Waste of space**: Unused bytes in variable-length data
- **Limited flexibility**: Cannot handle variable-size structures

**Tagged Encoding**:
- **Type identification**: Each field tagged with type information
- **Self-describing**: Data includes format metadata
- **Flexible**: Handles variable-length and optional fields
- **Overhead**: Additional bytes for tags

**External Data Representation (XDR)**:
```
Integer (32-bit): Big-endian format
Boolean: 0 = false, 1 = true  
String: Length + UTF-8 bytes + padding
Array: Length + elements
Structure: Concatenated fields
```

#### Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
**Google's data serialization** protocol.

**Features**:
- **Language-neutral**: Support for multiple programming languages
- **Binary format**: Compact binary encoding
- **Schema evolution**: Backward and forward compatibility
- **Code generation**: Automatic stub generation

**Example Definition**:
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

message Person {
    string name = 1;
    int32 id = 2;
    string email = 3;
    repeated string phone = 4;
}
```

### Interface Definition Languages (IDL)
**Specification languages** for defining remote interfaces.

#### Purpose of IDL
- **Language independence**: Define interfaces independent of implementation language
- **Type safety**: Specify parameter and return types
- **Automatic code generation**: Generate client and server stubs
- **Documentation**: Serve as interface contracts

#### Common IDL Examples

**CORBA IDL**:
```idl
interface Calculator {
    double add(in double a, in double b);
    double multiply(in double a, in double b);
    exception DivisionByZero {};
    double divide(in double a, in double b) raises(DivisionByZero);
};
```

**Apache Thrift**:
```thrift
service Calculator {
    double add(1: double a, 2: double b),
    double multiply(1: double a, 2: double b),
    double divide(1: double a, 2: double b) throws (1: DivisionByZero ex)
}
```

### RPC Semantics
**Behavior guarantees** for remote procedure calls in presence of failures.

#### Failure Scenarios
- **Client failures**: Client crashes before/after sending request
- **Server failures**: Server crashes before/after processing request
- **Network failures**: Messages lost, duplicated, or delayed
- **Partial failures**: Some operations succeed while others fail

#### Semantic Models

**At-least-once Semantics**:
- **Guarantee**: Procedure executed one or more times
- **Implementation**: Retry until acknowledgment received
- **Problem**: Duplicate executions if ACK lost
- **Use case**: Idempotent operations (reading data)

**At-most-once Semantics**:
- **Guarantee**: Procedure executed zero or one time
- **Implementation**: Duplicate detection using sequence numbers
- **Problem**: May not execute if first attempt fails
- **Use case**: Non-idempotent operations (money transfers)

**Exactly-once Semantics**:
- **Guarantee**: Procedure executed exactly one time
- **Reality**: Impossible to achieve in asynchronous networks
- **Approximation**: At-most-once + reliable delivery
- **Implementation**: Complex protocols with persistent state

### gRPC
**Modern RPC framework** developed by Google.

#### Key Features
- **HTTP/2 transport**: Multiplexing, flow control, header compression

# Synchronization & Coordination

## Clock Synchronization

### Physical Clocks
**Hardware-based timekeeping** mechanisms in distributed systems.

#### Clock Characteristics
- **Drift rate**: Rate at which clock deviates from real time
- **Accuracy**: How close clock is to real time
- **Precision**: Consistency between multiple clocks
- **Resolution**: Smallest time unit the clock can measure

#### Clock Drift
**Natural tendency** of clocks to deviate from perfect time.

**Drift Formula**:
```
C(t) = t + drift_rate × t + offset
where:
C(t) = Clock reading at time t
drift_rate = Clock's drift rate (typically 10^-6)
offset = Initial clock offset
```

**Practical Implications**:
- **Computer clocks**: Drift rate ~10^-6 (1 second per 11.6 days)
- **Quartz crystals**: Affected by temperature, aging, manufacturing
- **Atomic clocks**: Extremely accurate but expensive
- **GPS clocks**: Satellite-based time synchronization

### Logical Clocks
**Event ordering mechanisms** without requiring synchronized physical clocks.

#### Happened-Before Relation
**Partial ordering** of events in distributed systems.

**Definition** (Lamport):
Event a happened-before event b (a → b) if:
1. **Same process**: a and b in same process and a occurs before b
2. **Message passing**: a is send event and b is receive event of same message
3. **Transitivity**: If a → b and b → c, then a → c

**Properties**:
- **Irreflexive**: Event cannot happen-before itself
- **Anti-symmetric**: If a → b, then not b → a
- **Transitive**: Relation propagates through event chains

#### Concurrent Events
**Events not related** by happened-before relation.

Events a and b are **concurrent** (a || b) if:
- Neither a → b nor b → a
- Cannot determine ordering from causality
- May occur in any order in different processes

### Lamport Timestamps
**Logical timestamps** assigning ordering to events.

#### Algorithm
Each process maintains **logical clock** LC:

1. **Local event**: LC = LC + 1
2. **Send message**: Attach current LC to message, then LC = LC + 1
3. **Receive message**: LC = max(LC, received_timestamp) + 1

#### Timestamp Properties
- **Clock condition**: If a → b, then LC(a) < LC(b)
- **Total ordering**: Break ties using process IDs
- **Causal consistency**: Preserves causal relationships

#### Example
```
Process P1: Event a (LC=1) → Send msg (LC=2)
Process P2: Receive msg (LC=max(0,2)+1=3) → Event b (LC=4)
Result: LC(a)=1, LC(send)=2, LC(receive)=3, LC(b)=4
```

### Vector Clocks
**Multi-dimensional logical clocks** capturing causal dependencies.

#### Algorithm
Each process i maintains **vector clock** VC[i]:

1. **Initialize**: VC[i] = [0, 0, ..., 0]
2. **Local event**: VC[i][i] = VC[i][i] + 1
3. **Send message**: Attach VC[i] to message, then VC[i][i] = VC[i][i] + 1
4. **Receive message**: 
   ```
   VC[i][j] = max(VC[i][j], received_VC[j]) for all j
   VC[i][i] = VC[i][i] + 1
   ```

#### Vector Clock Comparison
For events with timestamps VA and VB:
- **VA = VB**: VA[i] = VB[i] for all i (same event)
- **VA < VB**: VA[i] ≤ VB[i] for all i, and ∃j: VA[j] < VB[j] (causally related)
- **VA || VB**: Otherwise (concurrent events)

#### Properties
- **Strong clock condition**: a → b ⟺ VC(a) < VC(b)
- **Concurrency detection**: Can determine if events are concurrent
- **Causal delivery**: Ensure causal message ordering

### Clock Synchronization Algorithms

#### Cristian's Algorithm
**Centralized synchronization** using time server.

**Protocol**:
1. Client requests time from server at local time T₀
2. Server responds with time T₁
3. Client receives response at local time T₂
4. Client sets time to: T₁ + (T₂ - T₀)/2

**Accuracy**: ±(T₂ - T₀)/2 - min_transmission_time

#### Berkeley Algorithm

**Protocol**:
1. **Time daemon** polls all machines for their times
2. **Calculate average** time across all machines

- **Stratum 0**: Reference clocks (atomic, GPS)
- **Stratum 1**: Primary servers directly connected to stratum 0
- **Stratum 2**: Secondary servers synchronized to stratum 1
- **Stratum 15**: Maximum stratum level

#### NTP Synchronization
**Message exchange** for time synchronization:

```
Client → Server: t₁ (client timestamp)
Server → Client: t₂ (server receive), t₃ (server send)
Client receives: t₄ (client receive)

Clock offset: θ = ((t₂ - t₁) + (t₃ - t₄)) / 2
Round-trip delay: δ = (t₄ - t₁) - (t₃ - t₂)
```

#### NTP Features
- **Multiple servers**: Client synchronizes with multiple servers
- **Outlier detection**: Filter out servers with bad time
- **Gradual adjustment**: Slowly adjust clock to avoid jumps
- **Accuracy**: Achieves millisecond accuracy over Internet

### TrueTime (Google Spanner)
**Global clock synchronization** providing time uncertainty bounds.

#### TrueTime API
```
TT.now() returns interval [earliest, latest]
TT.after(t) returns true if t has definitely passed
TT.before(t) returns true if t has definitely not arrived
```

#### Implementation
- **GPS and atomic clocks**: Multiple time sources per datacenter
- **Time masters**: Servers with GPS receivers and atomic clocks
- **Time slaves**: Machines synchronized to time masters
- **Uncertainty bounds**: ε typically < 10ms

#### Applications

### Bully Algorithm
**Aggressive election** algorithm where higher ID processes "bully" lower ones.

#### Algorithm
When process P detects coordinator failure:

1. **Election message**: Send ELECTION to all higher ID processes
2. **Wait for responses**: If no ANSWER received, P becomes coordinator
3. **Receive ELECTION**: Send ANSWER and start own election
4. **Coordinator message**: Winner broadcasts COORDINATOR to all

#### Example
```
Processes: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 (P5 was coordinator, now failed)
P2 detects failure:
1. P2 → ELECTION → P3, P4, P5
2. P3, P4 → ANSWER → P2
3. P3 starts election: P3 → ELECTION → P4, P5
4. P4 → ANSWER → P3, starts election: P4 → ELECTION → P5
5. P4 becomes coordinator: P4 → COORDINATOR → P1, P2, P3
```

#### Characteristics

2. **Forward message**: Each process adds its ID and forwards
3. **Complete circuit**: When message returns to originator
4. **Select coordinator**: Process with highest ID becomes coordinator
5. **Announce coordinator**: COORDINATOR message circulates ring

#### Example
```
Ring: P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P1
P2 starts election:
1. P2 → ELECTION(2) → P3
2. P3 → ELECTION(2,3) → P4  
3. P4 → ELECTION(2,3,4) → P5
4. P5 → ELECTION(2,3,4,5) → P1
5. P1 → ELECTION(1,2,3,4,5) → P2
6. P2 sees its ID, max is 5: P5 is coordinator
7. P2 → COORDINATOR(5) → P3 → ... → P1
```

#### Characteristics

- **Time complexity**: 2n message delays
- **Ring topology**: Requires logical ring organization
- **Single election**: Only one election at a time

### Leader Election in Distributed Hash Tables

#### Chord DHT Election

## Distributed Transactions

### ACID Properties in Distributed Systems
**Transaction properties** extended to distributed environment.

#### Atomicity
**All-or-nothing execution** across multiple sites.
- **Global atomicity**: Either all sites commit or all abort
- **Site failures**: Partial execution must be undone
- **Two-phase commit**: Standard protocol for atomicity
- **Compensation**: Semantic undo for committed transactions

#### Consistency  
**System remains consistent** across all sites.
- **Global consistency**: All integrity constraints maintained
- **Cross-site constraints**: Constraints spanning multiple databases
- **Eventual consistency**: Relaxed consistency models
- **Causal consistency**: Preserve causally related operations

- **Distributed logging**: Coordinated logging across sites

### Two-Phase Commit (2PC)
**Standard protocol** for distributed transaction atomicity.

#### Participants
- **Transaction manager (TM)**: Coordinates transaction
- **Resource managers (RM)**: Manage individual resources
- **Communication**: Reliable message passing between participants

#### Protocol Phases

**Phase 1 - Voting Phase**:
1. **Prepare**: TM sends PREPARE to all RMs
2. **Vote**: Each RM votes YES (ready to commit) or NO (abort)
3. **Timeout**: TM aborts if any RM doesn't respond

**Phase 2 - Commit Phase**:
1. **Decision**: TM decides based on votes
   - All YES → COMMIT
   - Any NO → ABORT
2. **Notify**: TM sends decision to all RMs
3. **Acknowledge**: RMs acknowledge receipt of decision

#### State Diagram
```
RM States:          TM States:
WORKING → PREPARED  INITIAL → WAIT → COMMIT/ABORT
    |         |         |        |         |
    v         v         v        v         v
  ABORT   COMMIT/ABORT  ABORT   COMMIT    END
```

#### 2PC Properties
- **Blocking protocol**: RMs block until TM decision
- **Timeout handling**: Participants can timeout and abort
- **Recovery**: Use transaction log for crash recovery
- **Message complexity**: 3n messages (n PREPAREs, n votes, n commits)

#### 2PC Problems
- **Blocking**: If TM fails after sending PREPARE, RMs block
- **Single point of failure**: TM failure can block system
- **Timeout uncertainty**: Cannot distinguish slow vs. failed processes

### Three-Phase Commit (3PC)
**Non-blocking extension** of two-phase commit.

#### Additional Phase
**Pre-commit phase** added between prepare and commit phases.

#### Protocol Phases

**Phase 1 - Voting Phase**:
- Same as 2PC Phase 1

**Phase 2 - Pre-commit Phase**:
1. **Pre-commit**: If all voted YES, TM sends PRE-COMMIT
2. **Acknowledge**: RMs acknowledge PRE-COMMIT
3. **Timeout**: TM can still abort in this phase

**Phase 3 - Commit Phase**:
1. **Commit**: TM sends COMMIT to all RMs
2. **Complete**: RMs commit and acknowledge

#### 3PC Properties
- **Non-blocking**: Participants can make progress during failures
- **Higher message cost**: 4n messages vs. 3n for 2PC
- **Timeout protocols**: Sophisticated timeout and recovery procedures
- **Network partition**: Can violate consistency during partitions

### Paxos Commit
**Consensus-based commit** protocol using Paxos algorithm.

#### Key Idea
**Replace TM** with replicated decision-making using Paxos consensus.

#### Protocol
1. **Prepare phase**: Similar to 2PC, collect votes from RMs
2. **Paxos consensus**: Use Paxos to agree on commit/abort decision
3. **Commit phase**: Execute agreed decision at all RMs

#### Advantages
- **Fault tolerance**: Survives f failures with 2f+1 coordinators
- **Non-blocking**: Progress possible with majority of coordinators
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency guarantees

#### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: More complex than 2PC/3PC
- **Message overhead**: Higher message complexity
- **Performance**: Multiple rounds of consensus

### Distributed Deadlock Detection
**Identify deadlocks** spanning multiple sites in distributed systems.

#### Global Wait-For Graph
**Combine local wait-for graphs** from all sites.

**Construction**:
1. **Local graphs**: Each site maintains local wait-for graph
2. **External edges**: Edges between transactions on different sites
3. **Global graph**: Union of all local graphs and external edges
4. **Cycle detection**: Deadlock exists if global graph has cycles

#### Detection Algorithms

**Centralized Detection**:
- **Central coordinator**: One site collects all wait-for information
- **Periodic collection**: Gather information at regular intervals
- **Global cycle detection**: Find cycles in global graph
- **Resolution**: Abort transactions to break cycles

**Distributed Detection**:
- **Probe-based algorithms**: Send probes along wait-for edges
- **Edge chasing**: Follow edges to detect cycles
- **Distributed cycle detection**: Each site participates in detection
- **Local decisions**: Sites make local abort decisions

#### Deadlock Resolution

# Consistency & Replication

## Data Consistency Models

### Strong Consistency
**Strictest consistency model** where all replicas are always synchronized.

#### Linearizability
**Strongest single-object consistency** model.

**Definition**: Operations appear to execute atomically at some point between their start and completion times, and all operations appear to execute in a single, total order.

**Properties**:
- **Real-time ordering**: If operation A completes before operation B starts, then A appears before B in the execution order
- **Single copy illusion**: System behaves as if only one copy of data exists
- **Composability**: Linearizable objects can be composed to form linearizable systems

**Example**:
```
Process P1: write(x, 1) [start=1, end=3]
Process P2: read(x) → 1 [start=2, end=4]
Process P3: read(x) → 1 [start=4, end=5]

Linearization point: write(x,1) at time=2
All subsequent reads see value 1
```

#### Sequential Consistency
**Weaker than linearizability** but maintains program order per process.

**Definition**: All operations appear to execute in some sequential order, and operations from each process appear in program order.

**Difference from Linearizability**:
- **No real-time constraint**: Operations don't need to respect global real-time ordering
- **Program order**: Only maintains order within each process
- **Global ordering**: Still requires global sequential execution order

**Example**:
```
Process P1: write(x, 1); write(x, 2)
Process P2: read(x) → 2; read(x) → 1

Sequential consistency violated: reads don't follow any sequential order
Linearizability also violated: second read sees older value
```

#### Serializability
**Database consistency model** for transaction execution.

**Definition**: Concurrent execution of transactions is equivalent to some serial execution of the same transactions.

**Types**:
- **Conflict serializability**: Based on conflicting operations (read-write, write-write)
- **View serializability**: Based on which writes each read observes
- **Two-phase locking**: Common implementation technique

**Serializability Graph**:
- **Nodes**: Transactions
- **Edges**: Conflicts between transactions
- **Acyclic graph**: Indicates serializable schedule

### Weak Consistency
**Relaxed consistency models** trading consistency for performance and availability.

#### Eventual Consistency
**System becomes consistent** given sufficient time without updates.

**Properties**:
- **Convergence**: All replicas eventually converge to same value
- **No guarantees**: No bound on convergence time
- **Conflict resolution**: Requires mechanisms to resolve conflicts
- **High availability**: Allows operations during network partitions

**Applications**:
- **DNS**: Domain name system updates propagate eventually
- **Web caching**: Cache invalidation happens eventually
- **NoSQL databases**: Many NoSQL systems use eventual consistency
- **Version control**: Git repositories converge through merging

#### Causal Consistency
**Preserve causally related operations** while allowing concurrent operations to be seen differently.

**Definition**: Operations that are causally related are seen by all processes in the same order. Concurrent operations may be seen in different orders.

**Implementation**:
- **Vector clocks**: Track causal dependencies
- **Causal broadcast**: Deliver messages in causal order
- **Dependency tracking**: Maintain causal relationship information

**Example**:
```
Process P1: write(x, 1) → send msg to P2
Process P2: receive msg → write(y, 2)

Causal relationship: write(x,1) → write(y,2)
All processes must see write(x,1) before write(y,2)
```

### Session Guarantees
**Client-centric consistency models** for mobile computing environments.

#### Read-Your-Writes Consistency
**Clients always see their own updates**.

**Guarantee**: If process writes value v to object x, subsequent reads of x by same process return v or later value.

**Implementation**:
- **Write tracking**: Track which replicas have client's writes
- **Read routing**: Route reads to replicas with client's writes
- **Version vectors**: Use version information to ensure freshness

#### Monotonic Read Consistency
**Successive reads return same or more recent values**.

**Guarantee**: If process reads value v from object x, subsequent reads of x by same process return v or later value.

**Implementation**:
- **Replica selection**: Always read from same or more up-to-date replica
- **Version tracking**: Track replica versions seen by client
- **Session state**: Maintain client session information

#### Monotonic Write Consistency
**Client's writes are applied in order**.

**Guarantee**: If process writes value v to object x, then writes value w to x, all processes see write(x,v) before write(x,w).

**Implementation**:
- **Write ordering**: Ensure writes from same client are ordered
- **Primary replica**: Route all writes through primary
- **Sequence numbers**: Use sequence numbers for write ordering

#### Writes-Follow-Reads Consistency
**Writes follow previous reads** from same client.

**Guarantee**: If process reads value v from object x, then writes to any object, that write operation follows the write that produced v.

**Implementation**:
- **Dependency tracking**: Track read dependencies for writes
- **Causal ordering**: Ensure writes respect read dependencies
- **Vector timestamps**: Use vector clocks for dependency tracking

## Replication Strategies

### Passive (Primary-Backup) Replication
**Single primary replica** handles all updates, backups provide fault tolerance.

#### Architecture
```
Client → Primary Replica → Backup Replicas
         (All updates)    (Replicated state)
```

#### Protocol
1. **Client request**: All requests sent to primary replica
2. **Primary processing**: Primary executes operation and updates state
3. **State transfer**: Primary sends state changes to backup replicas
4. **Acknowledgment**: Primary responds to client after backups acknowledge
5. **Failover**: Backup promoted to primary on primary failure

#### Characteristics
- **Strong consistency**: All updates go through single primary
- **Simple coordination**: No conflict resolution needed
- **Single point of failure**: Primary failure requires failover
- **Sequential bottleneck**: Primary can become performance bottleneck

#### Failover Process
1. **Failure detection**: Monitor detects primary failure
2. **Backup selection**: Choose backup to promote (often predetermined)
3. **State reconciliation**: Ensure new primary has latest state
4. **Client redirection**: Redirect clients to new primary
5. **Recovery**: Failed primary rejoins as backup when recovered

### Active Replication
**All replicas process all requests** independently.

#### Architecture
```
Client → All Replicas (broadcast)
         ↓
      Same computation
         ↓
      Identical results
```

#### Protocol
1. **Broadcast request**: Client broadcasts request to all replicas
2. **Ordered delivery**: All replicas receive requests in same order
3. **Deterministic processing**: All replicas execute same operations
4. **Result agreement**: All replicas produce identical results
5. **Response**: Client receives responses from all replicas

#### Requirements
- **Deterministic processing**: Operations must be deterministic
- **Ordered delivery**: Total ordering of all requests
- **Reliable broadcast**: Ensure all replicas receive all requests
- **Byzantine fault tolerance**: Handle arbitrary replica failures

#### Advantages
- **No single point of failure**: Any replica can handle requests
- **Fast response**: No coordination delay between replicas
- **Byzantine fault tolerance**: Can tolerate malicious failures

#### Disadvantages
- **Resource overhead**: All replicas do same work
- **Determinism requirement**: Limits types of operations
- **Ordering overhead**: Total ordering can be expensive

### Semi-Active Replication
**Hybrid approach** combining primary-backup and active replication.

#### Approach 1: Primary with Active Backups
- **Primary handles requests**: Single primary for client interactions
- **Active backup processing**: Backups also process operations
- **State comparison**: Compare results between primary and backups
- **Divergence detection**: Detect and handle inconsistencies

#### Approach 2: Active Processing, Primary Coordination
- **All replicas process**: All replicas execute operations
- **Primary coordinates**: Primary handles ordering and responses
- **Backup validation**: Backups validate primary's decisions
- **Fallback mechanism**: Switch to pure active if primary fails

### Multi-Master Replication
**Multiple replicas** can accept write operations.

#### Conflict Types
- **Write-write conflicts**: Concurrent updates to same data
- **Topology conflicts**: Different network partitions update data
- **Timestamp conflicts**: Updates with inconsistent timestamps
- **Semantic conflicts**: Updates violate application constraints

#### Conflict Resolution Strategies

**Last-Write-Wins (LWW)**:
- **Timestamp ordering**: Use timestamps to order conflicting writes
- **Simple implementation**: Easy to implement and understand  
- **Data loss**: Earlier writes are lost permanently
- **Clock synchronization**: Requires synchronized clocks

**Vector Clocks**:
- **Causal ordering**: Preserve causal relationships between updates
- **Concurrent detection**: Identify truly concurrent updates
- **Application resolution**: Let application resolve concurrent conflicts
- **Storage overhead**: Vector clocks grow with number of replicas

**Operational Transformation**:
- **Operation-based**: Transform operations rather than states
- **Concurrent operations**: Transform operations to work with concurrent changes
- **Convergence guarantee**: All replicas converge to same state
- **Complex implementation**: Requires careful operation transformation design

### Update Propagation Methods

#### Immediate Propagation
**Updates propagated** immediately to all replicas.

**Synchronous Propagation**:
- **Blocking updates**: Update blocks until all replicas acknowledge
- **Strong consistency**: Ensures immediate consistency
- **High latency**: Network delays affect update latency
- **Low availability**: Any replica failure blocks updates

**Asynchronous Propagation**:
- **Non-blocking updates**: Update returns immediately
- **Background propagation**: Updates propagated in background
- **Better performance**: Lower latency for update operations
- **Temporary inconsistency**: Replicas may be temporarily inconsistent

#### Periodic Propagation
**Updates batched** and propagated at regular intervals.

**Advantages**:
- **Efficient batching**: Reduce network overhead
- **Conflict resolution**: Time to resolve conflicts before propagation
- **Resource management**: Control resource usage for propagation

**Disadvantages**:
- **Staleness**: Replicas may be stale until next propagation
- **Batch size trade-off**: Large batches vs. frequent propagation
- **Complexity**: Need to manage propagation scheduling

#### On-Demand Propagation
**Updates propagated** only when accessed.

**Pull-based**:
- **Replicas poll**: Replicas periodically check for updates
- **Lazy propagation**: Updates propagated only when needed
- **Cache-like behavior**: Similar to cache invalidation

**Push-based**:
- **Primary notifies**: Primary notifies replicas when updates available
- **Subscription model**: Replicas subscribe to update notifications
- **Event-driven**: Updates triggered by events

## Consistency Protocols

### Primary-Based Protocols
**Single primary replica** coordinates all updates.

#### Remote-Write Protocol
**All writes go to primary**, reads can go to any replica.

**Protocol**:
1. **Write request**: Client sends write to primary
2. **Primary update**: Primary updates its local copy
3. **Propagate update**: Primary propagates update to backups
4. **Acknowledge**: Primary acknowledges to client after local update

**Characteristics**:

- **Network efficiency**: Reduces remote write latency

**Disadvantages**:
- **Migration overhead**: Cost of moving primary replica
- **Complex coordination**: Managing primary location
- **Thrashing**: Frequent migrations with distributed writes

### Replicated-Write Protocols
**Multiple replicas** can handle write operations.

#### Quorum-Based Protocols
**Majority consensus** for read and write operations.

**Quorum Requirements**:
```
N = Total number of replicas
R = Read quorum size
W = Write quorum size
Constraints: R + W > N, W > N/2
```

**Read Protocol**:
1. **Contact R replicas**: Send read request to R replicas

- **Owner**: Which cache has write permission
- **State**: Shared, exclusive, or invalid

**Protocol**:
1. **Cache miss**: Cache requests data from directory
2. **Directory lookup**: Directory checks current state and sharers
3. **Invalidation**: Directory invalidates old copies if necessary
4. **Data transfer**: Directory arranges data transfer to requesting cache

### Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)

#### State-Based CRDTs (CvRDTs)
**Replicas exchange entire state**.

**Requirements**:
- **Partially ordered set**: States form partial order (lattice)
- **Merge function**: Least upper bound operation for states
- **Monotonic updates**: Local updates only increase state in partial order

**Example - G-Counter (Grow-only Counter)**:
```
State: Array of counters, one per replica
Merge: Element-wise maximum of arrays
Increment: Increase own counter in array
Query: Sum of all counters in array
```

#### Operation-Based CRDTs (CmRDTs)
**Replicas exchange operations**.

**Requirements**:
- **Reliable broadcast**: All operations delivered to all replicas
- **Causal delivery**: Operations delivered in causal order
- **Concurrent commutativity**: Concurrent operations commute

**Example - OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set)**:
```
Operations: add(element, unique_id), remove(element, {unique_ids})
State: (added_elements, removed_elements)

Remove: Include all unique identifiers for element
Query: Elements in added but not in removed
```

## 6. Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance is the ability of a distributed system to continue operating correctly despite the occurrence of failures in some of its components.

### 6.1. Basic Concepts

- **Availability**: Readiness for correct service (uptime percentage)
- **Reliability**: Continuity of correct service over time
- **Safety**: Absence of catastrophic consequences on users and environment

where λ = failure rate, t = time
```

**Fault Models:**

where μ = mean response time, σ = standard deviation, k = safety factor
```

**Adaptive Failure Detection:**

Distributed consensus is the problem of getting multiple distributed processes to agree on a single value or decision, even in the presence of failures.

### 7.1. Consensus Problem

**Problem Definition:**
- Multiple processes propose values
- All correct processes must decide on the same value
- Decided value must be one of the proposed values

**Consensus Properties:**
- **Agreement**: No two correct processes decide different values
- **Validity**: Decided value must be proposed by some process
- **Termination**: All correct processes eventually decide

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
∀ processes p, q: decision(p) = decision(q) (Agreement)
∃ process r: decided_value ∈ proposed_values(r) (Validity)
∀ correct process p: eventually decides (Termination)
```

### 7.2. FLP Impossibility Result

**Fischer-Lynch-Paterson Theorem (1985):**
In an asynchronous network with even one process failure, no deterministic consensus algorithm can guarantee termination.

**Key Insights:**
- **Asynchrony**: Cannot distinguish slow processes from failed ones
- **Impossibility**: Applies to deterministic algorithms only
- **Workarounds**: Randomization, partial synchrony, failure detectors

**Implications:**
```

Solutions:
1. Randomized algorithms (expected termination)
2. Synchronous assumptions (timeouts)
3. Failure detectors (eventually perfect)
```

### 7.3. Paxos Algorithm

**Basic Paxos Roles:**
- **Proposers**: Propose values for consensus
- **Acceptors**: Vote on proposed values
- **Learners**: Learn the chosen value

**Two-Phase Protocol:**
1. **Prepare Phase**: Proposer sends prepare(n) to acceptors
2. **Accept Phase**: Proposer sends accept(n, v) to acceptors

**Paxos Guarantees:**
```
Safety: At most one value is chosen
Liveness: If majority of acceptors are correct, some value is eventually chosen

Prepare(n): Promise not to accept proposals < n
Accept(n, v): Accept proposal if n ≥ highest promised number
```

**Multi-Paxos:**
- Optimize for multiple consensus instances
- Eliminate prepare phase for stable leader
- Single leader handles multiple proposals

**Fast Paxos:**
- Clients send directly to acceptors (bypass proposer)
- Faster but requires larger quorums
- Trade-off: speed vs. fault tolerance

2. Find nonce: hash(block + nonce) < target
3. Broadcast block to network
4. Network validates and extends chain

Security: Requires > 50% computational power to attack
```

**Proof-of-Stake (PoS):**
- Validators chosen based on stake ownership
- Lower energy consumption than PoW
- Slashing conditions for malicious behavior

```
Validator Selection:
P(selected) ∝ stake_amount / total_stake

Slashing Conditions:
- Double voting (vote for conflicting blocks)
- Surround voting (violate finality rules)
```
